Our program is a Medical Bill Translator & Negotiator that helps patients better understand their medical bills. 
It will allow users to upload a bill, translate medical codes into plain language, and flag common errors such as duplicates or overcharges. 
The system will also provide a negotiation template to help patients dispute or reduce charges.
